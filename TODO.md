    - i really hope that works

- [] experiment with writing my own shaders!

- [] save/load
    - can't really do this with javascript
    - but! we can save/load stuff with local storage
    and when quiting/loading a world, we can prompt the user to
    download/upload a world file!
    - Only issue is that local storage has a limit but you might
    be able to turn it to unlimited?

- [] copy minecraft terminology
    - chunk is 16x16xWORLD_HEIGHT
    - subchunk is 16x16x16

- [] distant horizons!
    - either use an existing version
    - or figure out how to make this myself
    - LOD
    - far away chunks could be painted on a skybox?

- [] use this for transparent blocks
    - https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/Material.transparent
    - water, glass
    - reflections/refraction??? pls

- [] chunking
    - generating chunks should happen on a separate thread to not block
    the main thread and to not cause studders
